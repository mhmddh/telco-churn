## Setup and data inspection

This project inspects a telecom customer snapshot before building a model
to predict customer churn.

### Install the environment

Install Python 3.12 and uv, then run from the project directory:

```powershell
uv sync --locked
```

### Obtain the dataset

Download the [original CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/telco-customer-churn-on-icp4d/1fd6fd70906479be1712e64cfc0ea89f58466629/data/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv)
and save it as `data/raw/telco.csv`. Keep the original file unchanged.

Expected SHA-256:

```text
16320c9c1ec72448db59aa0a26a0b95401046bef5d02fd3aeb906448e3055e91
```

Verify the local file:

```powershell
uv run python -m telco_churn.scripts.hash_data
```

### Run the inspection

```powershell
uv run python -m telco_churn.scripts.inspect_data
```

The script saves `reports/data_overview.json`, containing dataset dimensions,
column types, target counts and proportions, duplicate customer-ID count,
missing and blank-value counts, source hash, and Python/pandas versions.

The raw CSV and local environment are excluded from Git.
